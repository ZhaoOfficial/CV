    '''Calculates color difference over all neighboring pixels over all color channels.

    The dissimilarity measure relies on the premise that adjacent jigsaw pieces in the original image tend to share
    similar colors along their abutting edges, i.e., the sum (over all neighboring pixels) of squared color differences
    (over all three color bands) should be minimal. Let pieces pi , pj be represented in RGB
    space by corresponding W x W x 3 matrices, where W is the height/width of each piece (in pixels).

    :params first:        First input piece for calculation.
    :params second:       Second input piece for calculation.
    :params orientation:  How input pieces are oriented.
    :params method:       The way to calculate the error.

                          LR => 'Left - Right'
                          TD => 'Top - Down'

        >>> from gaps.fitness import dissimilarity_measure
        >>> from gaps.piece import Piece
        >>> p1, p2 = Piece(), Piece()
        >>> dissimilarity_measure(p1, p2, method = 'Mahalanobis', orientation = 'TD')
